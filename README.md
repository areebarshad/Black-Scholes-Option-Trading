# Black-Scholes Option Trading

- A Python-based implementation of the **Black-Scholes option pricing model** with additional modules for backtesting, strategy simulation, and risk management.
- This project is designed as an **industry grade trading research tool**, enabling users to calculate option prices, implied volatility, and evaluate trading strategies using historical market data.

## Features

- **Black-Scholes Pricing**:
    - Calculate call and put option prices
    - Supports European-style options
    - Greeks calculation for risk assessment

- **Implied Volatility Solver**:
    - Iterative numerical approach to estimate IV from market prices

- **Historical Data Loader**:
    - Pulls and formats historical asset price data for analysis

- **Strategy Simulation**
    - Customizable long/short strategies
    - Hedging modules to test delta-neutral positions

- **Backtesting**
    - Trade execution simulation using historical data 
    - PnL tracking and performance metrics

- **Volatility Forecasting**
    - Realized volatility estimation for risk models
